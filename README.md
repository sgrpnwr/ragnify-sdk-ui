Ragnify SDK UI is a lightweight Next.js experience that includes a welcome screen,
login/register form, and an editable SDK installation guide.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the
updated welcome screen and SDK info section.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates
as you edit the file.

### Notes

- Validation is powered by React Hook Form and Yup.
- API key generation is mocked client-side and ready to be swapped with your
	real endpoint.
